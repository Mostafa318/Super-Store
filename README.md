# Super-Store

this project includ four main phases :
1. Cleaning and preparing data for builing Data Base in Power Bi
2. Statistics
3. Machine Learning
4. Dashboard


## Section 1

  There is a file called Superstore.sql in the Superstore.zip file. By running this file,
  all the tables and rows used for the final test will be created in your database. 
  Before running this file, make sure to create a database with the desired name and at the beginning of this file, use YOUR_DB_NAME; enter.

  In the continuation of this phase, the design of the data warehouse should be done according to the available primary data.
  According to the training given, the design of the data warehouse should include Fact and Dimension tables and be as close to the star structure as possible.
  The existence of keys and table connections is very important.

  ### Things that are important in this phase
    Receiving basic information and pre-processing and cleaning the data
    Designing the data warehouse structure
    Create keys and table relationships
    Importing the tables in Power BI and ensuring that the tables have the correct connections
    All the above operations should be done by power bi. If help is taken from another program, 80% of the question mark will be awarded to your team.

 ### Tips and extra points
    The presence of more detailed information in general Dimension tables such as DimDate and DimGeography and...
    Adding more information to the tables based on the creativity of the group members, for example adding Latitude and Longitude to 
    DimGeography and similar.
    New and creative ideas.

## Section 2
  Every time you have seen a store that has discounted its products, you must have thought that: "These stores are deceiving people with these discounts and sell a lot of stuff, so they make more money." Is this really true?
Based on the data provided, test the hypothesis that discounting items will cause a significant change in sales volume.
To do this, you need to divide the data into discounted and undiscounted categories. Next, examine the distribution of the number of items sold in each category, and then use statistical methods to determine whether there is a significant difference between the two categories.

## Section 3
  ### First Question
    One of the most important questions used in the analysis of different companies is the estimation of profit obtained. One of the 
    applications of profit estimation is predicting future events and making decisions for company strategies.
    In this section, you are asked to train a model that calculates the profit of a product sold by using the data you have,       
    preprocessing it, and selecting the appropriate features. In other words, you need to design a model that predicts the profit column 
    using all the features of the data. For this, you can use any model that suits you. In this matter, pay attention to the fact that 
    your model is generalizable and do not suffer from the problem of overfitting.

 ### Second Question
       One of the profitable ways of online sales companies is special shipping methods. Usually, companies sell special services to 
       customers that send goods faster in exchange for more money. The company whose data is provided to you will want to know what ship 
       mode each order is likely to be shipped with. With this information, the company can encourage customers to go for more expensive 
       services by offering a small discount on different types of transportation. For example, if a new order is going to be sent in a 
       standard way, the company can put a small discount on second class to encourage the customer and make the transportation model one 
       step better. In this section, after pre-processing the data and selecting the appropriate features, you should train a model that 
       predicts the ship mode for each order, with all the features.

## Section 4
  ### First Part
      In the first part, use the data obtained from statistics and machine learning and bring their reports here. Important explanation:        The data must be added to the data in Power BI
  ### Second Part 
      In the second part, you must answer the questions asked by the manager, which include:
      1.Determine the size of each market (based on average and total sales) and explain which market is the most reasonable to invest in?
      2.Find the relationship between the order amount and the shipping cost of the product. (We want to know if those who have more 
       expensive orders pay more for sending the product or not?)
      3.What is the average order shipping for each type of shipment in different countries? (Put yourself in the place of the manager,we 
      4.should be able to easily get reports for each region - for example, Europe.)
      On which day of the week (Saturday, Sunday, ...) was the sale more?
      5.What products does the store make the most profit from? (both based on the general category and based on each gender in each 
      category).
      6.Define a criterion that calculates the difference between the profit of each type and the average profit and use this criterion 
      to find out which area has brought more profit to the store?
 ### Third Part 
      In the third part, you must add at least 2 items to the above items so that you can provide a complete report to the collection.
