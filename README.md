# Super-Store

this project includ four main phases :
1. Cleaning and preparing data for builing Data Base in Power Bi
2. Statistics
3. Machine Learning
4. Dashboard


## Section 1

  There is a file called Superstore.sql in the Superstore.zip file. By running this file,
  all the tables and rows used for the final test will be created in your database. 
  Before running this file, make sure to create a database with the desired name and at the beginning of this file, use YOUR_DB_NAME; enter.

  In the continuation of this phase, the design of the data warehouse should be done according to the available primary data.
  According to the training given, the design of the data warehouse should include Fact and Dimension tables and be as close to the star structure as possible.
  The existence of keys and table connections is very important.

  ### Things that are important in this phase
    Receiving basic information and pre-processing and cleaning the data
    Designing the data warehouse structure
    Create keys and table relationships
    Importing the tables in power bi and ensuring that the tables have the correct connections
    All the above operations should be done by power bi. If help is taken from another program, 80% of the question mark will be awarded to your team.

 ### Tips and extra points
    The presence of more detailed information in general Dimension tables such as DimDate and DimGeography and...
    Adding more information to the tables based on the creativity of the group members, for example adding Latitude and Longitude to DimGeography and similar.
    New and creative ideas.
